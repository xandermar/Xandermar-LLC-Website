### 1. Install Docker Desktop

Lando runs on Docker, so it must be installed first.

* Download Docker for Mac: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* Open the `.dmg` file and drag Docker to Applications.
* Launch Docker from Applications and ensure it's running in your menu bar.
* You may be asked to authorize privileged access — approve it.

### 2. Install Lando

Download the latest Lando installer:

* Visit [https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/installation/](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/installation/)
* Click the **macOS download** link and open the `.pkg` installer.
* Follow the installation steps.

### 1. Create a Project Directory

```bash
mkdir my-lando-app
cd my-lando-app
```

### 2. Initialize a Lando App

```bash
lando init
```

You’ll be prompted to choose:

* A recipe (like `drupal`, `wordpress`, `laravel`, `lamp`, etc.)
* A name
* A codebase directory (use `.` for current)

Example:

```bash
? From where should we get your app's codebase? Use the current directory
? What recipe do you want to use? drupal10
? What do you want to call this app? my-lando-site
```

### 3. Start Lando

```bash
lando start
```

Lando will:

* Pull the necessary Docker images
* Set up your environment
* Give you URLs for your local site

### 4. Access Your App

After the build is complete, you’ll see output like:

```
BOOMSHAKALAKA!!! Your app has started up correctly.
Visit it in your browser: http://my-lando-site.lndo.site
```
